The OpenSimulator BulletSPlugin expects to use a "BulletSim.dll" which 
provides the linkage to the Bullet physics engine. BulletSim.dll is
written in C++ and is statically linked with the Bullet engine.
BulletSim.dll must be compiled separately as the OpenSimulator build
environment only builds the C# code.

For Visual Studio 2008, the steps are:

1) Download Bullet v2.78 (http://code.google.com/p/bullet/downloads/)
2) Unpack the tgz or zip into the BulletSim directory (so there is a new
    directory "BulletSim/bullet-2.78/")
3) cd into the bullet directory and build using your preferred method
    For Visual Studio 2008, open "msvc/2008/BULLET_PHYSICS.sln"
4) cd into "BulletSim/"
5) Open and build with BulletSim.sln
6) Copy "BulletSim/Release/BulletSim.dll" into the
    OpenSimulator "bin/" directory

For Linux (tested on Ubuntu)
1) Download Bullet v2.78 (http://code.google.com/p/bullet/downloads/)
2) Unpack the tgz or zip into the BulletSim directory somewhere
3) Following the Bullet build instructions 
    (http://bulletphysics.org/mediawiki-1.5.8/index.php/Installation),
    create the directory "bullet-build" and cd into that directory.
    Do "cmake ../path/to/bullet/dir -G 'Unix Makefiles'"
    then "make -j4"
    then "sudo make install"
    This builds bullet and installs it into /usr/local.
4) cd back to the BulletSim directory
5) Do "make"
6) Copy "BulletSim.so" into the OpenSimulator "bin/" directory


This was developed with Bullet v2.78. If you use a different version, you will
need to change the include and library directories for the BulletSim compilation.

Building a 64 bit version is a little different because of problems
with linking static libraries into shared libraries. Because of this, you
need to build Bullet as a shared library (add the
"-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON" as explained at 
http://bulletphysics.org/mediawiki-1.5.8/index.php/Installation#Building
This will cause the installation to install .so files which you can
then build BulletSim against. You will also need to copy the Bullet .so's
into the OpenSim bin/ directory.
