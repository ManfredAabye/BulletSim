The OpenSimulator BulletSPlugin expects to use a "BulletSim.dll" which 
provides the linkage to the Bullet physics engine. BulletSim.dll is
written in C++ and is statically linked with the Bullet engine.
BulletSim.dll must be compiled separately as the OpenSimulator build
environment only builds the C# code.

For Visual Studio 2008, the steps are:

1) Download Bullet v2.79 (http://code.google.com/p/bullet/downloads/)
1a) If you are adventurous, you can fetch the latest v2.* from svn
    (http://code.google.com/p/bullet/source/checkout).
    As of this writing (Jan 23, 2012), Bullet development is only doing
    bug fixes on the v2 branch and new development is happening
    on a new v3 branch.  When Bullet advances to v3, BulletSim
    will probably not build or link and will require rework.
    In the mean time, any of the v2.79+ versions should work.
2) Unpack the tgz or zip into the BulletSim directory (so there is a new
    directory "BulletSim/bullet-2.79/")
3) Apply all the patches for bullet:
	cd bullet-2.79 ; for file in ../*.patch ; do cat $file | patch -p1 ; done
4) cd into the bullet directory and build using your preferred method
    For Visual Studio 2008, open "msvc/2008/0BulletSolution.sln"
    Build a "Release" version.
    To select, 32 or 64 bit versions, make sure the target system
    is the desired architecture. Windows does not select which DLL
    to run depending on the system type so you must put the correct
    architectured version in "BulletSim.dll". BulletSim is distributed
    with a 32 bit version named "BulletSim.dll" and a 64 bit version
    named "BulletSim-x86_64.dll".
4b) There is a Solution file for VS2010 named Bullet-2010.sln.
    While this does built BulletSim, make sure the Framework is
    set to 3.5 which is the version guaranteed to work with OpenSim.
5) cd into "BulletSim/"
6) Open and build with BulletSim.sln
7) Copy "BulletSim/Release/BulletSim.dll" into the
    OpenSimulator "bin/" directory

For Linux (tested on Ubuntu)
1) Download Bullet v2.79 (http://code.google.com/p/bullet/downloads/)
1b) As noted above, you can also fetch the latest Subversion
    version of the version 2 Bullet.
2) Unpack the tgz or zip into the BulletSim directory somewhere
3) Apply 'bullet-2.79.patch':
	cat bullet-2.79.patch | patch -p1
4) Follow the Bullet build instructions 
    (http://bulletphysics.org/mediawiki-1.5.8/index.php/Installation),
    create the directory "bullet-build" and cd into that directory.
    Do "cmake ../path/to/bullet/dir -G 'Unix Makefiles'"
    then "make -j4"
    then "sudo make install"
    This builds bullet and installs it into /usr/local.
5) cd back to the BulletSim directory
6) Do "make"
7) Copy "BulletSim.so" into the OpenSimulator "bin/" directory


This was developed with Bullet v2.79. If you use a different version, you will
need to change the include and library directories for the BulletSim compilation.

Building a 64 bit Linux version is a little different because of problems
with linking static libraries into shared libraries. Because of this, you
need to build Bullet as a shared library (add the
"-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON" as explained at 
http://bulletphysics.org/mediawiki-1.5.8/index.php/Installation#Building
This will cause the installation to install .so files which you can
then build BulletSim against. You also need to copy the Bullet .so's
into the OpenSim bin/ directory.
