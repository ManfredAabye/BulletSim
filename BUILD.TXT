The OpenSimulator BulletSPlugin expects to use a "BulletSim.dll" which
provides the linkage to the Bullet physics engine. BulletSim.dll is
written in C++ and is statically linked with the Bullet engine.
BulletSim.dll must be compiled separately as the OpenSimulator build
environment only builds the C# code.

At the moment, the build environment is for Visual Studio 2008.
The steps are:

1) Download Bullet v2.78 (http://code.google.com/p/bullet/downloads/)
2) Unpack the tgz or zip into the BulletSim directory (so there is a new
    directory "addon-modules/BulletSim/bullet-2.78/")
3) cd into the bullet directory and build using your preferred method
    For Visual Studio 2008, open "msvc/2008/BULLET_PHYSICS.sln"
4) cd into "addon-modules/BulletSim/"
5) Open and build with BulletSim.sln
6) Copy "addon-modules/BulletSim/Release/BulletSim.dll" into the
    OpenSimulator "bin/" directory


This was developed with Bullet v2.78. If you use a different version, you will
need to change the include and library directories for the BulletSim compilation.

If you build Bullet as a 64 bit library, there is a "BulletSim-2010.sln"
which will build a 64 bit version of "BulletSim.dll".
